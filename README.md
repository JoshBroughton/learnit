## ACS 1220 Authentication and Authorization Final Project

This project is a reddit-inspired content delivery website focused on
the creation, sharing, and consumption of flash cards. The idea is to
put the desire to scroll the web to good use by allowing people to 
create, share, and study decks (equivalent to subreddits) of flashcards
(equivalent to posts).

The project uses the Flask framework coupled with WTForms and SQLAlchemy.
