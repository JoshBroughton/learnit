## ACS 1220 Authentication and Authorization Final Project

This project is a reddit-inspired content delivery website focused on
the creation, sharing, and consumption of flash cards. The idea is to
put the desire to scroll the web to good use by allowing people to
create, share, and study decks (equivalent to subreddits) of flashcards
(equivalent to posts).

The project uses the Flask framework coupled with WTForms and SQLAlchemy.

## Run the project with docker compose

You can run this app locally by running `docker compose up` from the root directory of the repository.
Access the running app at `localhost:5000`
